# Homicides-and-Weather-Temperature
In general, my goal is to find out if there could be any relationship between homicides and weather temperature. 
To achieve that I needed the temperature data of the homicide cases. I found the monthly average data from the NOAA website. 
I found three data files over there, Hawaii monthly average temperature data, Alaska monthly average temperature data and another with all other 48 states monthly average temperature data. Joining these three separate data sets, I made a data file with all the 50 states monthly average data and finally joined the monthly average column as 'temp' to our main homicide data set.

Link of the Dataset:
The homicide data set comes from Kaggle and contains roughly 638,000 observations.

Additionally, the monthly weather temperature data was collected from NOAA.GOV and contains roughly 75000 records.
